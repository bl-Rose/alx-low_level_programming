Debugging is the process of identifying and resolving errors or issues in computer programs. It is an essential skill for software developers to find and fix problems in their code. Debugging involves pinpointing the root cause of unexpected behavior, such as crashes, incorrect output, or performance issues, and then making necessary corrections.

Methods of Debugging Manually:

Print Statements (console.log, print, etc.): Inserting print statements into your code can help you understand the program's flow and the values of variables at different points. This is a simple and effective method for understanding what your code is doing.

Code Review: Sometimes, a fresh pair of eyes can catch issues. Review your code or have a colleague review it to spot logical errors or potential problems.

Rubber Duck Debugging: Explain your code and the problem you're facing to an inanimate object or a coworker (hence the "rubber duck" metaphor). This can help you see the issue from a different perspective.

Breakpoints: In an integrated development environment (IDE), you can set breakpoints in your code. When the program reaches a breakpoint, it stops execution, allowing you to inspect variables, step through code, and understand the state of your program.
