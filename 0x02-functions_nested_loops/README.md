Nested loops are like when you do something repeatedly, and inside that, you do something else repeatedly. It's like a double or even triple action!
Imagine you're drawing a grid of squares. You go from left to right, drawing squares, and then you go down a row and do it again. You're using one loop to move left and another loop to move down.
